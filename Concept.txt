Virtual Fish Tank

Concept
	Take care of some virtual fish by feeding them and keeping them healthy and happy.  Over time your tank gets dirty, so you'll need to clean it to keep your fish healthy.  If you fish get sick, you'll need to give them medicine to make them better.  Accessories in the tank can help reduce stress and keep your fish healthy and happy.
