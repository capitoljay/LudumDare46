# LudumDare46
This is the game I made for Ludum Dare 46.  The theme was "Keep it alive" so my first thought was keeping fish alive in an aquarium.  So I went to work building Virtual Fish tank.  

The code here has undergone some major enhancements post-jam, so it's far better than what I submitted to LD46.  If you want to see the original source from my submission, you can find it at https://www.dropbox.com/s/3ngxvdef6mylvkj/VirtualFishTank-SourceCode-04192020.zip?dl=0
